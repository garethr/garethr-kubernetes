Puppet::Type.newtype(:kubernetes_endpoint_subset) do
  
  @doc = "EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:
  {
    Addresses: [{'ip': '10.10.1.1'}, {'ip': '10.10.2.2'}],
    Ports:     [{'name': 'a', 'port': 8675}, {'name': 'b', 'port': 309}]
  }
The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:
    a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],
    b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]"
